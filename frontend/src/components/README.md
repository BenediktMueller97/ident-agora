# Components

This directory contains reusable React components used throughout the application.

## Structure

- **Header.tsx** - Navigation header component
- Add more components as needed (e.g., Button, Input, Card, etc.)

## Guidelines

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the project's styling conventions with Tailwind CSS
- Export components as default exports
